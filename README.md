# Digit Recognition using ANN (From Scratch)

This project implements a digit recognition system using a fully connected
Artificial Neural Network built from scratch in Python without using
high-level deep learning frameworks.

## Features
- Manual implementation of forward propagation
- Backpropagation from scratch
- Custom weight initialization
- Training and evaluation logic

## Dataset
This project uses the **MNIST handwritten digits dataset**.

Due to GitHub file size limits, the dataset is not included in this repository.

Download options:
- Google Drive: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lxNl1pg2oEGW1NLky6pe-J4s87g3g9g_/view?usp=share_link

After downloading, place the dataset in the project root directory.

## How to Run
```bash
python digit_recognition.py
